Making Wellbeing was an exhibition and related programme that assembled key themes, recent explorations and interventions in the built environment that impact wellbeing at all stages of life, from birth to death.

The project was made for The Built Environment Trust and included exhibition identity, display boards, plinths and digital elements.
