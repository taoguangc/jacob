Visual Identity for a London based architecture firm. The visual identity for GUNN was developed with focus on creating a brand which has its roots in architectonic aesthetics and reflects their values and ambitions. The identity utilises a broad range of gridded patterns and layouts that take their inspiration from architectural plans and are combined with a clean and simple design approach.

A key aspect of my involvement in this project was to implement the visual identity on all brand assets. Consisting of everything from customised personal business cards to presentation templates in Indesign and legal documents for the Office package.
